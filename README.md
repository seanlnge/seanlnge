## Hi

I'm Sean, a freshman at the University of South Florida, and have been programming for ~6 years. I started off by making simple Python scripts such as a Pi calculator and CLI games, but found my love for coding by making browser games with the HTML canvas.

After a year or two of finding my place within Javascript, I wanted to branch out into server-side development, seeing if I was determined enough to learn how to create multiplayer games using websockets and fullstack web apps with Node and Express.

With the coronavirus pandemic in full force and school off, I broadened my view of the software development ecosystem, trying out all types of languages and software development tools such as Rust, C#, Kotlin, and even building some of my own: [programming language](https://github.com/QuestLang), [JS rendering framework](https://renderspice-docs.replit.app/).

Today, I have found my niche with anything Typescript. I am currently working on **Multyx**, a multiplayer browser game hoster and framework [(try it out)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multyx). I love to meet other software dev people, so feel free to reach out!
